# PCB DESIGNING

This repository showcases my practical experience in **Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Design** using industry-standard EDA tools. It includes schematic capture, PCB layout design, routing, DRC validation, and Gerber file generation for fabrication.



##  Tools & Software Used
- KiCad – Schematic design & PCB layout



##  Technical Skills Demonstrated
- Schematic capture and circuit design
- Component selection and footprint mapping
- 2-layer PCB layout design
- Power and ground plane implementation
- Manual and auto routing techniques
- Design Rule Check (DRC) error debugging
- Basic signal integrity and noise reduction
- Gerber file export for manufacturing



##  Projects Included
- Breadboard Power Supply PCB
- Pico Satellite Design PCB

##  Objective
To develop industry-ready PCB design skills aligned with Embedded Systems and Core Electronics roles, focusing on clean layout practices, manufacturability, and hardware reliability.
